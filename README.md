# GoWithTheFlow
A restaurent roulette android app developed using java and Firebase
Go with the Flow is a fun projected I devloped using Firebase and Java in Android Studio. 
The app allows the user to create an account and log in and once the user is logged in the user has access to his/her profile with access to edit credentials.
Once the user clicks on spin the wheel. The user is presented with a spinning wheel that suggests a restaurent around Montreal.
This is my first project with Android. I am happy to hear suggestions.
